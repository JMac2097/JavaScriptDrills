    <h2>Encapsulate</h2>
    <p>
      Encapsulate is a programming concept that refers to the practice of
      bundling data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that
      data into a single unit known as a "class" in object-oriented programming
      or a "module" in other programming paradigms. The purpose of encapsulation
      is to hide the internal details of an object or module and provide a
      controlled interface for interacting with it. Here are the key aspects of
      encapsulation: Data Hiding: Encapsulation involves hiding the internal
      state (data) of an object or module from the outside world. This means
      that the data should not be directly accessible or modifiable by external
      code. Access Control: Instead of allowing unrestricted access to an
      object's data, encapsulation typically defines a set of methods (or
      functions) that provide controlled access to the data. These methods are
      often referred to as "getters" and "setters." Information Hiding:
      Encapsulation promotes the principle of "information hiding," which means
      that the internal details of how an object or module works are hidden from
      the user of that object or module. Users interact with the object or
      module through a well-defined interface. Modularity: Encapsulation
      contributes to modularity by organizing code into self-contained units
      (classes or modules). This makes it easier to manage and maintain a large
      codebase, as changes to one module typically don't affect other parts of
      the program as long as the external interface remains the same. Data
      Validation and Control: By encapsulating data and providing controlled
      access, encapsulation allows for data validation and control. It ensures
      that data is consistent and valid throughout its lifecycle. Encapsulation
      is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), where
      classes are used to encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior
      (methods) into objects. OOP languages like Java, C++, and Python rely
      heavily on encapsulation to create reusable and maintainable code.
      However, the concept of encapsulation is not limited to OOP and can be
      applied in various programming paradigms to achieve similar goals of
      organization, data protection, and information hiding.
