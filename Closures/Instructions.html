		<h1>Closures Instructions</h1>
		<p>JavaScript closures can be powerful when it comes to maintaining
			state and encapsulating behavior. Here are a few advanced level
			drills that involve using closures and maintaining state in event
			listeners</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Accordion Component: Create an accordion component that
				allows users to click on different sections to expand and
				collapse their content. Each section should have a title and
				content. Use closures to maintain the state of each section and
				ensure that only one section is expanded at a time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Debounce and Throttle: Implement a debounce and throttle
				utility using closures. Debounce should delay the execution of a
				function until after a certain amount of time has passed since
				the last invocation, while throttle should limit the number of
				times a function can be called within a specific time interval.
			</li>
			<li>
				Custom Tooltip: Build a custom tooltip that shows additional
				information when users hover over specific elements. The tooltip
				should be positioned close to the mouse pointer and disappear
				after a short delay when the mouse moves out of the target area.
				Closures can be used to manage the tooltip's state and timing.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tabs Component: Create a tabs component that displays
				different content based on the active tab selected by the user.
				Use closures to keep track of the active tab state and to handle
				the click event on each tab.
			</li>
			<li>
				Drag-and-Drop: Implement a drag-and-drop functionality using
				closures. Create draggable elements that users can move around
				within a specific container. Use closures to maintain the state
				of the dragged element and its position.
			</li>
			<li>
				Counter with Custom Step: Build a counter with custom step
				functionality that allows users to specify the step value when
				incrementing or decrementing the counter. Use closures to store
				and update the current count and step.
			</li>
			<li>
				Form Validation: Develop a form validation library using
				closures. The library should allow you to define validation
				rules for different form fields and display appropriate error
				messages when the form is submitted. Closures can be used to
				manage the state of each form field's validation status.
			</li>
			<li>
				Infinite Scroll: Create an infinite scroll feature for a list
				of items. When users scroll down, new items should be
				dynamically loaded without refreshing the page. Use closures to
				keep track of the current page and load more items as needed.
			</li>
		</ul>
        <p>
			Remember, closures in JavaScript allow functions to "remember" the
			scope in which they were created, even after the outer function has
			finished executing. This makes them useful for maintaining state and
			encapsulating behavior in various scenarios, such as the ones
			mentioned above. Happy coding!
