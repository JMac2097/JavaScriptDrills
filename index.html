<!-- Some project notes 

Create a seperate folder for each of the subjects that you have stored in Obsidian.
Create an instructions file for each folder with a list of all of the drills.
Create a seperate file for each drill.
Figure out a nice way to show these drills off, maybe the drill, then the result. |Writing about it along with the example might be a very useful exercise for me.
Each file needs to link, so that the "site" is fully navigable.
Once we get some of the basics down, we can start to add some more advanced features, navigation, etc.
When are are pretty much there with content, we can start to add some styling.
We can then look at gettin g it on a better platform, thinking Next.js, or something similar.
If its going well, we can look at publishing it, and then we can start to add some more advanced features, like a login, and a way to track progress, etc.
Might even be able to add in a playground, so that people can try out the code, and see the results.
