    <h1>Async Drills</h1>
    <p>
      Here are some drills you can use to practice asynchronous JavaScript,
      including fetch, AJAX, and debugging techniques: 1. Fetch API Drill: Use
      the Fetch API to make an HTTP GET request to retrieve data from a remote
      server. For example, fetch a list of users from an API and display them on
      a web page. Remember to handle the promise returned by the fetch function.
      2. AJAX Drill: Utilize the XMLHttpRequest object to send an asynchronous
      request to the server and handle the response. Create a simple form that
      sends data to the server without refreshing the page. Use the
      `onreadystatechange` event to handle the response. 3. Promises Drill:
      Practice working with promises to manage asynchronous operations. Create a
      function that returns a promise and resolves after a certain delay. Chain
      multiple promises together using `then` and handle errors using `catch`.
      For example, create a chain of promises to fetch data from different APIs
      sequentially. 4. Async/Await Drill: Use async/await syntax to write
      asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. Convert a promise-based
      function to use async/await. For instance, rewrite a fetch request using
      async/await to simplify the code and make it more readable. 5. Debugging
      Drill: Debug asynchronous code using tools like console.log, breakpoints,
      and the browser's developer console. Place console.log statements at
      different stages of your asynchronous code to track the flow and values of
      variables. Use breakpoints to pause the execution at specific points and
      examine the state of variables. 6. Event Loop Drill: Understand how the
      event loop works and how it helps manage asynchronous code. Create a
      sample program with multiple setTimeout or setInterval functions and
      observe how they are executed in the event loop. Use the event loop to
      solve common issues like blocking the main thread or causing long-running
      operations. Remember to practice these drills in the context of real-world
      scenarios to gain a better understanding of how to handle asynchronous
      operations and utilize the event loop effectively.
